In this document, you can find the design of the project made during the checkpoints throughout the semester:

### Homework 1: Project Topic Selection and First Design Sheet

Your first task is to look for the data and topic of your semestral project and start brainstorming some ideas about the design of your visualizations. When searching for the topic/data, please try to pick something that has at least 2 of the following properties:

-    Data is multidimensional (there are 3+ attributes of the same type)
-    Different types of attributes are present (e.g., numerical, categorical, textual, ...)
-    Data has a temporal aspect 
-    Data is (geo)spatial
-    Data contains networks/trees/hierarchies

Use the first design sheet from the [Five Design Sheets](http://fds.design/) methodology to help you organize your ideas about the project. Don't be afraid to include also incomplete and wacky ideas or questions that you would like to answer with your visualization, but do not yet know how. This stage is all about brainstorming.

### Homework 2: Sheet 2/3/4 - Initial Project Design

Your second task concerns the layout and interactions of your semestral project. Use the sheet 2/3/4 from the [Five Design Sheets](http://fds.design/) methodology to help you create design for your project - use different visualization techniques, different interactions, and/or focus on different tasks that your project could support.

### Homework 3: Sheet 5 - Final Project Design

Your third task concerns the final layout and interactions of your semestral project. Use sheet 5 from the [Five Design Sheets](http://fds.design/) to help you create the final designs for your project, which you will then use as a template for your implementation. Think also about technologies and tools that you will use for your implementation and how they will affect your project.
